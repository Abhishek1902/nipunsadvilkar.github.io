description: I am a self-taught programmer who started programming in low level languages to do projects in Arduino & Atmel microcontrollers. Through them, I realized my eagerness towards code and sooner or later I had an epiphany that control and perception are challenging things in Artificial Intelligence which lead to my career in Machine learning. I have been working on a variety of problems in the areas of Machine learning. As a passionate Machine learning engineer, I like to explore Jungle of Data with Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn as my Swiss-knife for survival.
